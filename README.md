Abstract The use of smart contracts and blockchain tokens to implement a consumer trustworthy ingredient certification scheme for foods including commingled, i.e. recipe based, food products is described. The proposed framework allows ingredients that carry any desired property (including social or environmental customer perceived value) to be certified by any certification authority, at the moment of harvest or extraction, using the IGR Ethereum token. The mechanism involves the transfer of tokens containing the internet Unified Resource Locator (URL) published at the authority's web site from farmer all along the supply chain to the final consumer at each transfer of custody of the ingredient using the CTE/KDE philosophy of the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). This allows the end consumer to easily inspect and be assured of the origin of the ingredient by means of a mobile application. The proof of concept for the framework was implemented, tested and is running as a beta version on the Ethereum live blockchain as the IGR token.The main contribution of the framework is the possibility to ensure the true origin of any instance or lot of ingredient within a recipe to the customer, without harming the food processor legitimate right to protect its recipes and suppliers.
